  📊 Spark-Based Big Data Project | 🔥 Power BI Reporting | 📁 5,000+ Match Records Analyzed
</p>

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete **data analytics pipeline** to evaluate **player and match performance** in the Indian Premier League (IPL).

Built using **Apache Spark**, **Python**, and **Power BI**, the system processes large datasets, performs transformation and aggregation, and uncovers insightful patterns from over **5,000+ ball-by-ball records**.

✔️ Improved reporting clarity by **10%** through visual dashboards  
✔️ Delivered real-time match stats & player trends  
✔️ Applied advanced Spark schema definitions and filtering

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| 🐍 **Python** | Data transformation, filtering, aggregation |
| ⚡ **Apache Spark (Databricks)** | Big data processing |
| 💾 **MySQL** | Structured querying and joins |
| 📊 **Power BI** | Dashboards and visual storytelling |
| 📚 **Libraries** | Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn |
| 🗂️ **Version Control** | Git & GitHub |

## 📂 Data Sources

- **Ball_By_Ball.csv** – All delivery-level events  
- **Match.csv** – Match metadata  
- **Player.csv** – Player demographic & role info  
- **Player_match.csv** – Per-match player statistics  
- **Team.csv** – Team identifiers and details

Each dataset was read using strict Spark `StructType` schemas to ensure accurate type parsing and null safety.

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Aggregated **match-level run totals** & **average per innings**
- Filtered **extra deliveries** (no-balls, wides) to improve scoring accuracy
- Identified **top-performing players**, frequent dismissal types, and **winning patterns**
- Linked **player data** with match results using structured joins

---

## 🧠 Challenges Faced

- ❗ Initial Spark error due to a typo in `matchid` → corrected to `match_id`
- ❗ Schema mismatches across CSVs required careful alignment
- ✅ Successfully resolved through debug logs and structured error handling

---

## 🖥️ Sample Visualization (Power BI)

📌 Dashboards include:
- Run trends by innings  
- Player vs. opponent breakdown  
- Win margins by season  
- Man of the Match distribution

_👉 Dashboards are available on request._
